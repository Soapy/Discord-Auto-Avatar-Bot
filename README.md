# Discord-Auto-Avatar-Bot
Self-Bot that changes your Discord avatar every x minutes.

I am not responsible for any issues that may arise from using a self-bot on the Discord platform.

More information regarding Discord's stance on this matter is located

# How to setup the bot:
Make sure to modify the config.txt file in order to setup the bot correctly.

You'll need to supply your discord info along with your ID too.
