# Discord-Auto-Avatar-Bot
A self-bot that changes your Discord avatar every 9 minutes. 
This value can be changed in the config file.

I am not responsible for any issues that may arise from using a self-bot
on the Discord platform.

More information regarding Discord's stance on this matter is located
[here](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002192352-Automated-user-accounts-self-bots-) 

# Usage
To use this bot, compile all the .java files in this repo
and setup the bot in accordance with the instructions in Setup.

Run the AutoAvatarBot by doing

**java AutoAvatarBot**

# Setup
Make sure to modify the config.txt file in order to setup the bot
correctly.

You'll need to supply your discord info along with your ID too. 

Add images into the images folder located within assets.

Currently, the only tested file extensions for images are only .png,
.jpg, and .jpeg. Other file extensions may be added but are not tested
for.

Adding new images into assets/images will require the bot's current
thread to be interrupted, or the bot itself in order to accommodate them.
